# Welcome to TrakStack

## TrakStack is an app that lets you search Spotify for tracks, albums, and artists, and then save unique tracks to a custom playlist. You can then save the playlist to your spotify account.

## Please note: Due to a Spotify security feature, the search function of this app MAY NOT WORK unless you are one of 25 unique users that I as the developer authorize to test the app. If you would like to be added to this list, please contact me via the email available on my GitHub or LinkedIn account (also accessible through my GitHub), and I will be happy to add you if there is room!

TrakStack was developed as part of the Codecademy Front End Engineer path. The default name of the project on Codecademy is "Jammming", but I wanted to put my own spin on it.

The name and logo were designed by Cambria Sullivan using Canva.com. The app was made with React and is hosted and deployed by Netlify.

This project was made for learning purposes and is not intended to represent an actual business or service. Although there is no reason that this application should cause any issues for the user, please be aware that this application comes with no warranty or guarantee of functionality.
